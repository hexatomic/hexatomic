Please describe.**\nCurrently, every editor has its own colour scheme and uses different colours for the same entities. E.g. the grid editor uses a dark green for spans, but the graph editor uses a bright green for token.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be nice, if the basic editors we provide as a Hexatomic project follow a common color scheme for annotated entities.","files":null}]}

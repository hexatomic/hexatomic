Please describe.**\n\nSometimes code review misses discrepancies between .tpd definition of the target platform, and the .target file which is create from .tpd, and that is used by Eclipe and Maven.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nAn automated solution. E.g., CI generates .target from .tpd and diffs against the committed .target. If there are any changes (other than `sequenceNumber`), CI commits to branch. Or something better.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAdd to PR template to check manually.","files":null}]}

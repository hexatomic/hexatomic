Typing is not possible there (which is good), but the user must move the cursor manually two positions up on the line to be able to type again.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\n\nTry it yourself.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n`Home` (or indeed other key operations, such as pressing left arrow) should not affect the `\u003e ` section of the console line. I.e., the user should not be able to move backwards beyond the whitespace after the prompt.","files":null}]}

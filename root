Hence, for wider grids with a long document name, the vertical scrollbars may be hidden in the original-sized window.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open the first GUM document in the grid editor without resizing the application window.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI'm unsure what this should be. There are several options:\n\n- Leave as is, and leave up to user to resize window\n- Resize part via `containerData` in part's parent part stack\n- Resize application window\n- Maximize application window\n- Place dropdown differently, and perhaps change/shorten content","files":null}]}

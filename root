Please describe.**\n\nI can see why the mouse wheel *alone* is used for zooming, as this may be the primary use case. However, I'd like to be able to use it to scroll as well, in combination with pressed Ctrl/Shift buttons.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nWhen the `Shift` button is pressed and I use the mouse wheel, I'd like to scroll vertically. When the `Ctrl` button is pressed and I use the mouse wheel, I'd like to scroll horizontally.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nOne could use (a key combination and) the arrow or paging buttons to achieve scrolling, but this seems clumsy for a fairly mouse-centric view.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nNot sure if this is already solved in the newer PR #124.","files":null}]}

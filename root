Please describe.**\n\nI'd *like* to have a \"reset graph\"/\"reset layout\"/\"reset view\" button in the graph viewer.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA click on this button - located somewhere in the top control section above the filter list - resets the graph layout.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nThe user can achieve a reset of the layout by making another selection and going back to the original one, but this seems unintuitive and hacky.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nNot urgent.","files":null}]}

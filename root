Open the first document of the Salt example in the graph viewer\n2. Include spans (the IOOBE should now be thrown)\n3. Select the second segment\n4. Additionally select the third segment -\u003e IOOBE is thrown\n\nCf. gif below, which also shows examples of #131 (watch for dual clicks).\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nSelecting more than one segment should not throw an exception, or, the exception message should point to issues in the model, if there are any (and if this causes the exception).\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![ioobe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/73950711-ad058500-48fc-11ea-81c1-e67fbf940169.gif)\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\n - Hexatomic Version: #124 \n - Java Version: OpenJDK 8","files":null}]}

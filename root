Open a project\n2. Open a document with more than one text in the graph viewer\n3. Select a segment X\n4. Check \"Include Spans\"\n5. Result: First segment in the list is selected, instead of all relevant segments under the selected X\n6. Select all relevant segments under X and X\n7. Uncheck \"Include Spans\"\n8. Segment X and n following segments are selected, instead of just segment X\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nSee above, a) segments under the selected segment are selected when spans are included, and b) on the root segments of all segments previously selected are selected when spans are excluded.\n\n**Screenshots**\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Operating System: [e.g. Ubuntu 18.04]\n - Hexatomic Version: [e.g. 1.0.3]\n - Java Version: [e.g. OpenJDK 8, Oracle JDK 11]\n \n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context about the problem here.","files":null}]}

All gone.\n\nAll on vanilla Salt example.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open the Salt example in the graph editor\n2. Try creating a pointing relation between\n    1. a structure and a token, or\n    2. a structure and a structure\n3. Boom!\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nPointing relations can be created between structures and other structures, or tokens.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/74045403-f3c2b000-49cc-11ea-8ede-196c3590950e.gif)","files":null}]}

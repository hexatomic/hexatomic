Please describe.**\n\nI need Hexatomic to let me annotate existing edges in the graph editor.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nThis should work the same way as annotating nodes.\n\n1. If the edge has an identifier (must be displayed, at least in a tooltip if we don't want to clutter the UI), use that, e.g., `a x:y #e1`.\n2. If it doesn't have an identifier, identify it via the nodes it connects, e.g., `a x:y #n1 \u003e #t1`.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nn/a","files":null}]}

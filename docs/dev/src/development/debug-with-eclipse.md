# Running and debugging Hexatomic in Eclipse

Hexatomic is a modular project and while it is possible to debug a user-defined sub-set of the bundles,
in most cases debugging the complete application is more useful.

To debug or start Hexatomic with all the features and bundles, you have to open the  `org.corpus_tools.hexatomic.product` project which contains the Hexatomic product definition.
In this project open the `org.corpus_tools.hexatomic.product` file in Eclipse.

To debug Hexatomic, click on the `Launch an Eclipse application in Debug mode` link on the overview tab of the product configuration file editor.
To just run the product, but not debug it, choose `Launch an Eclipse application` on the same page.

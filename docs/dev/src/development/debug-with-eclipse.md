# Running and debugging Hexatomic in Eclipse

Hexatomic is a modular project, and while it is possible to debug a user-defined subset of its bundles,
it may be more useful to debug the complete application.

To run or debug Hexatomic from within the Eclipse IDE, with all the features and bundles, you have to open the  `org.corpus_tools.hexatomic.product` project which contains the Hexatomic product definition.
In this project, open the `org.corpus_tools.hexatomic.product` file in Eclipse.

To debug Hexatomic, click on the `Launch an Eclipse application in Debug mode` link in the overview tab of the Product Configuration Editor.
To just run the product, but not debug it, choose `Launch an Eclipse application` on the same page.

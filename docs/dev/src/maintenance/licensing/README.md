## Automating the fulfillment of license requirements

In order to make it easier to maintain the licenses for Hexatomic and its dependencies, 
we automate the fulfillment of license requirements.

For this, Hexatomic includes the Maven License Plugin from MojoHaus in the build. 
You can read about the plugin on the [Maven License Plugin website](http://www.mojohaus.org/license-maven-plugin/index.html).

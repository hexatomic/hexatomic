## How do I do X? Why doesn’t Y work? Where can I go to get help?

This user documentation is the one-stop source of information on using Hexatomic, and can hopefully help you.

If you have read through it and haven't found an answer to your question, you can write to the <nobr>[**<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> Hexatomic User Mailing List**](https://sympa.cms.hu-berlin.de/sympa/info/hexatomic-users)</nobr> and ask your question there. (Please don't use the mailing list to report bugs, see [*I've found a bug!*](#ive-found-a-bug) instead.)

If you have an idea how we could make the documentation better so that the next person with your question can get it answered in the documentation, please let us know! "[The documentation didn't help me!](#the-documentation-didnt-help-me)" below shows you how to do this.

## The documentation didn't help me!

If you find that something is missing from the documentation, or that it could be made better in any way,
please let us know! The way to do this is through reporting this issue on Hexatomic's GitHub page (cf. [below](#reporting-issues) for how to do this).

## I've found a bug!

If you think you have found a bug, or Hexatomic does not work the way you have expected after reading the documentation, or Hexatomic doesn't work at all on your machine,
please let us know! The way to do this is through reporting this issue on Hexatomic's GitHub page (cf. [below](#reporting-issues) for how to do this).

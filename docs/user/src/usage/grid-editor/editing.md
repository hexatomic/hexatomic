# Editing values in the grid

To edit the values of annotations, you have to activate the cell editor.
The left-hand side of the screenshot above shows an activated cell editor.

There are several ways to activate a cell editor:

A. Double-click on the cell you want to edit.  
B. Press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key.  
C. Just start typing the new annotation value.

In the cell editor, type in the new annotation value and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to commit the new value.

You can **cancel** the edit by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
The cell value will remain the same as before you started editing it.

## Editing multiple values at once

You can edit multiple values at once.
To do so, select more than one cell (see [*Navigation and selection*](index.html#navigation-and-selection)), and press <kbd>Space</kbd>.
This will bring up a multi-cell editor window where you can enter the new value, and commit it by clicking **OK**, or pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
The right-hand side of the screenshot above shows three selected cells, and the multi-cell editor window to change their values.

As with the single cell editor, you can abort the edit by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or by clicking **Cancel**.

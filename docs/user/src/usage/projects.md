# Working with projects

Hexatomic works on a single Salt project at any one time.
A project consists of a directory containing a project file (`saltProject.salt`) and a number of sub-directories containing the Salt document files.

To open a project in Hexatomic, click on *File* in the main menu and select the option *Open Salt Project*.
A new file dialog window will come up.
Choose the folder containing the project file you want to open, and open it.

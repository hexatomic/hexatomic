# Refactoring

Hexatomic offers some so-called refactoring operations, which perform changes on
bulk. Refactoring operations can be applied to the whole project (via the menu
**Edit -> Refactor**) or on selected documents or sub-corpora, by clicking right
on selected item in the [“Corpus Structure” editor](../corpus-structure.md) and
opening the **Refactor** context menu item.

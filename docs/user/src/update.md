## Perform updates

1. If there are updates available, they will be performed automatically. Otherwise you will be informed that there are no updates available.
2. After successful installation, Hexatomic has to be restarted to apply the update. You will be asked if you want to restart. If you have unsaved changes, save them first and perform the restart manually.

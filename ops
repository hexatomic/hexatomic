E.g. in future versions we could deliberately allow to have patterns of edges and annotate all of them in the same time.\n\nWe can add an enhancement to \"find a way to identify edge\" by e.g. type and/or index but this in my opinion this is not a bug, but actually a feature that is consistent with the other behaviour of the console (e.g. having multiple node arguments which will all get the same annotation).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"725ac77188b9c2093ea4100ba878cd5190f5dc34"},"timestamp":1582308100,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA2MTM5ODI2Mw=="},"status":2}]}

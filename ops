Saving the whole project would be a single command and aligned with the concept to open a project. \nSince this is the only way to save the corpus structure, we definitely need a \"Save Project\". \n\nBut if we additionally allow to save only a changed document, we would need to make sure the user understands the difference.\nThis difference is also important for the status indicators: if every editor has its own status indicator the \"Save Project\" might seem insufficient for the user, since he expects to be able to save only this changes but not the one of other, possible hidden editors.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7fc094c5f01526c965e541ec82007c487f6fa288"},"timestamp":1580910562,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjQxNTgxMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic/issues/93#issuecomment-582415813"},"message":"Good point. I think document-only saves support user stories. Can we do this incrementally?\n\n1. Implement global \"Save project\" (and let user know about the implications in the docs)\n2. Additionally implement \"Save document\" as \"save editor contents\", document implications; not sure if this is feasible due to binary (?) dirty states?\n\nAlternatively, we could perhaps implement \"Save Project\" as an active action on the corpus structure view only, and \"Save document\" only on editor views?","files":null}]}

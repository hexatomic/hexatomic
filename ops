The graph editor part still opens.\n\nAnd obviously, if you run something in the console of that graph editor, e.g., `t Some text.`, it hangs (no error message in the console or simliar.)\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\n\nNot reproducible at the moment.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI would want\n\n- The graph editor part to *not* open when an error occurs (although this may be hard to achieve in the part lifecycle ...)\n- The console to display an error when I issue a command on a graph of a document that is `null`.\n\n**Screenshots**\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Operating System: [e.g. Ubuntu 18.04]\n - Hexatomic Version: [e.g. 1.0.3]\n - Java Version: [e.g. OpenJDK 8, Oracle JDK 11]\n \n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context about the problem here.","files":null}]}

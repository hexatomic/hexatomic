However, the error is piped to stdout but not to the user interface, as ANTLR continues parsing despite this error, and hence the error listener doesn't get wind of the error at all.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open a document in the graph editor and call `t I'm a test`\n2. The `'` is not tokenized, and the user is given no warning that it has been ignored. Instead, the log gives `line 1:3 token recognition error at: '''`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAn error message appears in the UI, notifying the user of this issue. The tokenization is rolled back and the user left at the state of the graph before the `t` call was issued.","files":null}]}

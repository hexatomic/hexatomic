This seems independent of timing, as waiting between clicks doesn't change behaviour.\n\nSometimes, the layout changes on the *first* click as well, while the selected additional segment isn't selected.\n\nYou can see this in the following screen recording (open in new tab so you can see everything). The first instance shows non-selection on first click, the second instance (cut together from a longer recording) shows a slight change in layout on the first click (`structure1 goes up a level) as well as non-selection. Selection always on the second click. Note that Ctrl has been pressed during all operations.\n\nI've also seen selection on the third click only, although I couldn't reproduce this.\n\nThis is also seems independent of #FIXME.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open the Salt example project\n2. Open the graph editor on the first document\n3. Deselect pointing relations\n4. Select spans\n5. Select second segment\n6. Press and hold `Ctrl`\n7.

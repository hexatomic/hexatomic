When you create a pointing relation between a token and a structure and annotate it with namespace:name:value (`e #structure12 -\u003e #sTok9 ns:n:a`), then try to create a new pointing relation between the same nodes, annotating it with a new value within the same namespace:name combination (`e #structure12 -\u003e #sTok9 ns:n:x`), \n\n- the console freezes (doesn't display a new prompt), and \n- an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open a document in the example corpus\n2. Do `e #structure12 -\u003e #sTok9 ns:n:a`\n3. Do `e #structure12 -\u003e #sTok9 ns:n:x`\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. The console doesn't freeze\n2. The pointing relation is created with the new annotation (unless Salt forbids having more than one pointing relation between model elements\n3. No error message is popped up, or the error message contains helpful hints (e.g., \"You cannot create more than one pointing relation between the same model elements\")\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![invalidrange](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/75027865-8a986d80-549f-11ea-97c8-e0c2c550f946.gif)\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04\n - Hexatomic Version: #150 \n - Java Version: OpenJDK 8","files":null}]}

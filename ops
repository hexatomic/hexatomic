Please describe.**\n\nIn addition to #110, we could also implement simple document creation via the GUI, e.g., with a command to \"Add document text\" on a document in the Project Manager. The question remains the same as in #110:\n\n- [ ] Tokenize on creation?\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA command on empty documents in the Project Manager, accessible via context menu. Triggers a multi-line text field to add or paste text into, which then gets set as TextualDS on the underlyong SDocumentGraph.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nRestrict to raw text import only, but this is slightly more clumsy for quick testing (for example) than adding the text in the GUI.","files":null}]}

All gone.\n\nAll on vanilla Salt example.\n\n**To reproduce the bug**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Open the Salt example in the graph editor\n2. Try creating a pointing relation between\n    1. a structure and a token, or\n    2. a structure and a structure\n3. Boom!\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nPointing relations can be created between structures and other structures, or tokens.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nLarge-ish (open in new tab).\n\n![e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/74045403-f3c2b000-49cc-11ea-8ede-196c3590950e.gif)","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"7fc094c5f01526c965e541ec82007c487f6fa288"},"timestamp":1581092007,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMTgyMjM4NTU="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7fc094c5f01526c965e541ec82007c487f6fa288"},"timestamp":1581092571,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzQ4MTAzNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic/issues/145#issuecomment-583481036"},"message":"Yo @all-contributors, I think it's about time to add @sdruskat for bug reports, eh!

Open a doc in the example corpus\n2. Do `e #structure3 -\u003e #structure5`\n3. Do `e #structure3 -\u003e #structure5` again\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. The edges are not drawn on top of each other but fanned (similar to relations connecting the same nodes but in different directions).\n2. The edges are distinguished by getting a label, similar to nodes.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/75028421-80c33a00-54a0-11ea-93e3-dfdce20c9f9d.png)\n\n**Additional context**\n\nArguably a corner case, but something we should cover as you never know what users will do, e.g., using different edges to accumulate several annotations.","files":null}]}

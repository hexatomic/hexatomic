This means that we (up to all four of us in lieu of external contributors) can be (shared) copyright holders as individuals, but not as \"the project\".\n\nCf. [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urheberrecht_(Deutschland)#Der_Rechtsinhaber_des_Urheberrechtes:_Der_Urheber), [lawyer's website 1](https://www.ra-plutte.de/ubersicht-zum-urheberrechtsschutz-von-computerprogrammen/), [lawyer's website 2](https://www.it-recht-kanzlei.de/Urheberrechte_an_Computerprogrammen.html#abschnitt_10), [lawyer's website 3](https://rickert.net/blog/urheberrechtlicher-schutz-von-software-im-arbeitsverhaeltnis/), [lawyer's website 4](https://rickert.net/blog/urheberrechtlicher-schutz-von-software-im-arbeitsverhaeltnis/), etc.\n\nExploitation rights in our case go to our employers, not the copyright though, which can only be transferred through death (nothing that we plan on). In short, our employers have the right to pick a license, which I interpret they have, by you, @VolkerGast and @AnkeLuedeling, agreeing to use the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\nSo the way I see it is that we do not have to mention the exploitation rights at all (as they have been acted on by way of licensing the work), but we cannot use the project as a copyright holder under German law. I think that it may be permissible to use something like \"(c) The Hexatomic contributors\" as this makes clear that it \n\n- refers only to those who have gained copyright through creative work, and \n- it is a defined Handrechtsgemeinschaft, which can be traced back to individuals (although not very future-proof).\n\nWhat do you think? This is something that I think should be discussed during the next project meeting.","files":null}]}

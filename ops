This could be implemented by selecting a token (perhaps an annotation cell for the specific token?), then creating the column based on the selection.\n    - on an `SSpan`, in which case we cannot be sure that model elements exist, or rather, which span to add the annotation to, or whether to create a new one for each annotation qName.

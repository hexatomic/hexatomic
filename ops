Please check if this is correct, and let me know where I didn't understand things correctly.\n\nNote that we will not depart from the generic data model Salt, i.e., will and can not extend it for specific use cases such as yours, but that it is possible to implement your model with Salt via different strategies (annotations, meta annotations, layers), and that it would generally be possible to implement annotation scheme support, and tagset support via the UI.\n\nOne clear constraint is that we do not have resources to implement this before we have hit our project target, although it could be implemented *right now* I think. If there is enough interest in this (you mentioned the systemic functional linguistics community), perhaps the interested group can find funding for an implementation.\n\n@thomaskrause Please check for false assessments above \u0026 let us know if you have other ideas how this could be implemented.\n\nThanks!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c08f33d948212201bfc91ffde88d0299f7b61986"},"timestamp":1591617714,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDU2MDE1NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic/issues/196#issuecomment-640560155"},"message":"Thank you for this analysis. This looks like a reasonable start capturing the main structural aspects. \n\n\nTo help making this less abstract, I provide (A) the syntactic overview for the Cardiff Grammar and (B) a poster containing an example of SFG analysis (instantiating a mixture of the Cardiff and Sydney Grammars). \n\nA. In these pictures, the section headings (e.g. Clause, Nominal Group, Quality group) signify unit classes, while the \"elements\" separated by pipe ( | ) signify syntactic functions and represent slots that can be filled by a child unit ( i.e. the edge labels in a constituency tree). \n\nSo indeed, some additional constraints may need to be specified of what functions a unit may accommodate, i.e.what child edge labels are permitted (eventually in which relative order and the probability of occurrence).\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13567133/84026617-effc6580-a98d-11ea-8ae5-793329877d98.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13567133/84026670-06a2bc80-a98e-11ea-8073-527e13a50def.png)\n\nB. This is an old poster (2014) with an illustration of how a merged multi-stratal SFG analysis may look like. \n[poster publisher 1.1.pdf](https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic/files/4745770/poster.publisher.1.1.pdf)","files":null}]}

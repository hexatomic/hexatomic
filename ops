Please describe.**\n\nWhenever the segments change in the graph (this could be by operations as small as adding a single structure node), the graph display is shot to pieces and the user has to re-select whatever they want to see. (Example gif from #143)\n\n![edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007126/74042566-13a3a500-49c8-11ea-9cf0-14d02bfc2670.gif)\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIdeally, the selection of segments to display in the graph view should adapt to the action, e.g.,\n\n- When I have selected a segment (or several segments) and do something like add a node, I want the new selection to be the old selection + the node, or rather, all segments that had been selected + any new segments that any new nodes are overlapping.\n\nTo be fair, this seems to be a problem with document with more than one `STextualDS` only. The Salt example with one DS performs fine.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.","files":null}]}

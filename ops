Or would a user expect that the (empty) column remains in place to be \n\n- re-filled with annotations (e.g., if the first annotation was erratic), or\n- explicitly deleted from the grid.\n\nThe current implementation keeps the model and view clean, while an alternative implementation - keeping empty columns within a session (they won't be rendered when loading a document) - may be more user-friendly.\n\nProbably something to ask users during beta testing.","files":null}]}

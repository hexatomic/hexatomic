Yes, our semantics are off. See the following post: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg\u0026th=173727\u0026goto=553104\u0026#msg_553104\n```\nThis is kind of a recurring problem: people don't seem to grasp how this\nkeyboard thingy works. Granted, it's a bit nebulous...\n\nThe property SWTBotPreferences.KEYBOARD_LAYOUT only tells SWTBot what\nkeyboard mapping file to use, so that it can type special characters\nproperly. But setting this property doesn't change your OS Keyboard\nmapping, Java can't do that. You'll need to do that yourself. So, for\nthis thing to work properly, you need to:\n1. Set your OS keyboard to EN_US\n2. Set SWTBotPreferences.KEYBOARD_LAYOUT to EN_US\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"725ac77188b9c2093ea4100ba878cd5190f5dc34"},"timestamp":1595504453,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mjk1NjMyOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/hexatomic/hexatomic/issues/202#issuecomment-662956329"},"message":"Actually, using \u003ckbd\u003eCtrl\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003e+\u003c/kbd\u003e as a shortcut for zooming in seems to be extremely unusable for en_US keyboards since this means they have to press the Shift modifier key as well.

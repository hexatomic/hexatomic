  abstract = {Abstract             This paper presents GATE Teamware\textemdash an open-source, web-based, collaborative text annotation framework. It enables users to carry out complex corpus annotation projects, involving distributed annotator teams. Different user roles are provided (annotator, manager, administrator) with customisable user interface functionalities, in order to support the complex workflows and user interactions that occur in corpus annotation projects. Documents may be pre-processed automatically, so that human annotators can begin with text that has already been pre-annotated and thus making them more efficient. The user interface is simple to learn, aimed at non-experts, and runs in an ordinary web browser, without need of additional software installation. GATE Teamware has been evaluated through the creation of several gold standard corpora and internal projects, as well as through external evaluation in commercial and EU text annotation projects. It is available as on-demand service on GateCloud.net, as well as open-source for self-installation.},

    abstract = "We introduce the third major release of WebAnno, a generic web-based annotation tool for distributed teams. New features in this release focus on semantic annotation tasks (e.g. semantic role labelling or event annotation) and allow the tight integration of semantic annotations with syntactic annotations. In particular, we introduce the concept of slot features, a novel constraint mechanism that allows modelling the interaction between semantic and syntactic annotations, as well as a new annotation user interface. The new features were developed and used in an annotation project for semantic roles on German texts. The paper briefly introduces this project and reports on experiences performing annotations with the new tool. On a comparative evaluation, our tool reaches significant speedups over WebAnno 2 for a semantic annotation task.",

  abstract = {Effectively managing the collaboration of many annotators is a crucial ingredient for the success of larger annotation projects. For collaboration, web-based tools offer a low-entry way gathering annotations from distributed contributors. While the management structure of annotation tools is more or less stable across projects, the kind of annotations vary widely between projects. The challenge for web-based tools for multi-layer text annotation is to combine ease of use and availability through the web with maximal flexibility regarding the types and layers of annotations. In this chapter, we outline requirements for web-based annotation tools in detail and review a variety of tools in respect to these requirements. Further, we discuss two web-based multi-layer annotation tools in detail: GATE Teamware and WebAnno. While differing in some aspects, both tools largely fulfill the requirements for today's web-based annotation tools. Finally, we point out further directions, such as increased schema flexibility and tighter integration of automation for annotation suggestions.},

The corpus contains herbal texts printed between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries and is concerned with the development of a German scientific register, independent of Latin. We will discuss difficulties of transcribing, normalizing and annotating historical texts and will thereby argue for the advantages of multiple layers and multiple tokenizations. A virtually infinite number of annotations can be added to the corpus, without the need for deciding between or discarding interpretations. Thus, this flexible architecture enables multiple normalizations and types of annotation and is open to a wide range of research questions in the humanities. We provide case studies concerning the exploitation of our different normalizations as well as structural, register-specific and linguistic annotations. The corpus architecture allows for its reuse as a resource for corpus-based research approaches.},

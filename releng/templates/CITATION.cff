title: Hexatomic
abstract: |-
  Hexatomic is an extensible, OS-independent platform for deep multi-layer linguistic annotation of corpora.

  It is being developed for sustainability, in order to support research software re-use rather than new development of software with each new research project.
  Using Hexatomic, linguistic research projects can implement what they need on top of an existing platform.

  To safeguard compatibility, Hexatomic works on instances of Salt projects. Salt is a generic metamodel for linguistic data.
